In his talk, Andreas Refsgaard will describe, how machine learning has become an integrated part of the practice. By enabling people to decide upon, and train their own unique controls for a system, the creative power shifts from the designer of the system to the person interacting with it.

The talk will include several of his playful projects, where he actively seeks out unconventional connections between inputs and outputs using simple machine learning techniques. Games are controlled by making silly sounds, music is composed by drawing instruments on paper and algorithms are trained to decide what is funny, funky or boring. 

More recently Andreas has been experimenting with using machine learning to create new text and images based on large amounts of training data. Amongst other things, he will take about his new project Booksby.ai - an online bookstore which sells science fiction novels generated by an artificial intelligence.
