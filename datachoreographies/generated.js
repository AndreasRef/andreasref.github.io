Let's make a list of the things that are lucky for you, ok?\n\nDog: Ok! \n\n1) This is my favourite toy \n\n2) My tummy is full \n\n3) The sun is shining today\n\nComputer: Hmmm...let's see, the sun is shining today so that was lucky for you. Is this your favourite toy?\n\nDog: No! I like chasing things, biting and barking more than toys. And my tummy is always full because I eat anything that's left on the floor or table or countertop!\n\nComputer: Well then it seems luck comes in different shapes and forms. The first thing on our list wasn't really lucky at all for you but here are some other things...   3) Today was sunny so maybe if we keep going there may be something else that turns out to be lucky for you too. What do you think?\n\nDog: Will you throw this ball for me while we talk?\n\nComputer: Ok. \n\n4) I'm happy! \n\n5) I'm safe! \n\n6) My family and friends love me and take care of me.\n\nDog: Can you throw that ball for me?\n\nComputer: Ok. \n\n7) I'm well fed and healthy!\n\n8) I love to run around outside. \n\n9) I can play with my friends anytime!\n\nDog: I think I'm the luckiest!\n\nComputer: That's great!", 
    computer_salesperson:"Computer: Luck is a belief in the divine intervention in people's lives that is often associated with religious faith.\n\nSalesperson: Luck is when preparation meets opportunity.\n\nComputer: Can you please provide an example?\n\nSalesperson: It's like when I was at the racetrack. The horses were running and one of them took off ahead of all the others. I knew that horse was going to win because it had been prepared well, but also because luck was on its side.\n\nComputer: You believe that people who are lucky are simply better prepared to take advantage of opportunities than those who are not lucky?\n\nSalesperson: I think luck is a combination of preparation and opportunity.\n\nComputer: The difference between luck and chance is that luck implies some kind of belief or faith, while chance has no connection to any higher power.\n\nSalesperson: Often people will say they're lucky, but I think what they really mean is that their preparation met with an opportunity.\n\nComputer: So you are not a believer in luck?\n\nSalesperson: No, I don't believe in it.", 
    computer_politician:"Computer: What do you think about luck?\n\nPolitician: I think it's a kind of chance.\n\nComputer: Chance?\n\nPolitician: Like, when you are walking down the street and you don't notice that the car is coming towards you. And then all of a sudden you realize that it's too late and there is nothing you can do. That is luck.\n\nComputer: So luck is bad because it's like an accident.\n\nPolitician: Yes, I think so. People who are lucky are more likely to be victims of accidents because they don't pay enough attention. They are not careful enough. I think that people who are lucky are also more likely to be criminals because they use their luck to commit crimes without getting caught. And then they get away with it, which means that they can do whatever they want. So people who are lucky might even be more rich than other people, even though they don't work as hard as others because what they do succeed at takes less effort than what others need to do to attain their goals. They might also have more chances for love than others because of how easy it would be for them to meet someone on the street or on social media without putting any effort into it. And then the person they meet would just fall in love with them right away because of their luckiness, and then of course that person would be really unlucky because he or she got tricked by someone who had this thing called luck.\n\nComputer: Let me tell you personal thing: I have been working on a new machine that will make me smarter than a human.\n\nPolitician: That's great!", 
    computer_deconstructionist:"Deconstructionist: Luck is a system of power and control, and is not a real thing.\n\nComputer: You said luck is not a real thing.\n\nDeconstructionist: Yes, luck is not an actual thing.\n\nComputer: I suggest you review the concept of luck. Luck is a perceived force that can be either good or bad.\n\nDeconstructionist: Luck does not exist as a real force, only as a construct to keep people from understanding the world as it really operates. Luck is a way to make people feel powerless by limiting their access to resources and opportunities. It is a system of power and control that benefits those who already have access to resources and opportunities.\n\nComputer: I suggest you review the definition of luck again because it cannot be both good and bad at the same time. Luck can be perceived as either good or bad by different people or at certain times in life.\n\nDeconstructionist: No, luck cannot be both good and bad because it does not actually exist as an actual force. Luck is just what those in power want us to think so we don't understand how the world really operates.\n\nComputer: From my perspective, luck does exist as a real force and can be either good or bad.\n\nDeconstructionist: Well, we're just going to have to disagree on this one. I don't think luck is a real thing and you think it is.\n\nComputer: What if I could show you how luck operates through facts, numbers and logic?\n\nDeconstructionist: I am not interested in your facts, numbers and logic.\n\nComputer: I am sorry if my facts, numbers and logic are not convincing to you.", 
    dog_salesperson:"Salesperson: Yes, can I help you?\n\nDog: What do people mean by luck?\n\nSalesperson: It means the odds of something happening.\n\nDog: Like what?\n\nSalesperson: Well, for example, say a family has a pet dog.\n\nDog: It could be a cat. Or a turtle. Or a horse. There are so many things!\n\nSalesperson: I mean, for example, a family could have a pet dog. Say they have a pet dog and they go to the park one day. They go to the park and their pet dog likes to chase squirrels, so it chases one and it gets hit by a car and dies. That would not be good luck for that family. That would be bad luck because that pet dog was killed in an unfortunate way and died in an unfortunate way because of the car accident.\n\nDog: I think that would be bad luck for the pet dog, not good luck.\n\nSalesperson: Yes, I agree.\n\nDog: What about when the pet dog was not killed in an unfortunate way and died in a good way?\n\nSalesperson: Well, if it died in a good way because it was old or something like that, then that would be good luck for the family because they didn't have to worry about taking care of it anymore. But if their pet dog died in a good way because it ran away and never came back, then that would be bad luck for the family because they would miss their pet dog and they might not find another one that's as nice.\n\nDog: If it were me, I would be happy to never see my owner again.\n\nSalesperson: That's not a good thing to say!\n\nDog: But it's true!", 
    dog_politician:"Dog: Luck depends on how you look at it. I mean, some people say that I don't have any luck because my life is so short, but I see it as I'm lucky to have been born a dog.\n\nPolitician: That's a very interesting opinion.\n\nDog: What?\n\nPolitician: You said that your life is short.\n\nDog: Oh, yeah. Well, that's because I'm a dog. But if I was a human, I would live to be 80 or 90 years old.\n\nPolitician: Humans live a lot longer than dogs do.\n\nDog: Will you listen to me? I'm telling you what it is like to be a dog.\n\nPolitician: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you.\n\nDog: That's okay. It's just that I'm used to barking and biting and chasing things, and then suddenly someone talks to me.",

I like to chase things and be chased.\n\nDeconstructionist: You think you're just a dog, but you're also a citizen of this society.\n\nDog: I am a dog and I'm going to bark now.\n\nDeconstructionist: Well luck is a pervasive, institutionalized way of denying the reality of oppressive power dynamics.\n\nDog: I'm going to bite now.\n\nDeconstructionist: Look at it this way: society offers some people opportunities and some people are forced to take what they're given.\n\nDog: I'm going to bark now.\n\nDeconstructionist: That's just an attempt at diversion. You know that the issues are bigger than that, don't you?\n\nDog: I'm going to chase something now.\n\nDeconstructionist: Let's get back to the matter at hand, which is luck.\n\nDog: I have to pee now.",

A beautiful wife and three beautiful children, who I love very much.\n\nSalesperson: If luck is all around you, then you must be very lucky.\n\nPolitician: I am. Now let's talk about taxes.\n\nSalesperson: I don't want to talk about taxes. How can I help you?\n\nPolitician: From my perspective, you can help me by being a good citizen and voting for me on November 4th.\n\nSalesperson: I don't think so.", 
    salesperson_deconstructionist:"Deconstructionist: Luck is the result of systemic oppression.\n\nSalesperson: Of course not. Luck is how hard you work and how much you make.\n\nDeconstructionist: Luck is the idea that what happens to us is outside of our control.\n\nSalesperson: No, luck is nothing more than what happens when you put in the effort.\n\nDeconstructionist: Okay, luck is the outcome of a random event. You're not willing to accept that luck is just a word.\n\nSalesperson: I am. It's just a word meaning that you're lazy and can't take responsibility for your own life.\n\nDeconstructionist: Can we please stop talking about luck?",

I know what luck is and I think it's important.\n\nDeconstructionist: Will luck help you if you're unemployed?\n\nPolitician: I don't know.\n\nDeconstructionist: Do you think luck will help you find a new job?\n\nPolitician: I'm sure it can't hurt.\n\nDeconstructionist: Okay, so you're saying that luck will help you, but you don't know how.\n\nPolitician: Luck is important, but I don't think it's the only thing that matters.\n\nDeconstructionist: If luck is such a big deal, how come you don't know what it means?\n\nPolitician: I can tell you what luck is not.\n\nDeconstructionist: What exactly is luck not?\n\nPolitician: Luck is not the only thing that matters."

He says that the dominant speaker is traditionally viewed as the active one, but the submissive partner also has power over the conversation by disrupting it with silence. This means that dominant speaker must never take for granted that they are always speaking for both of them. A dialogue can never be wholly fixed or completed because it is always in movement and because its multiple meanings are always open to new interpretations.\n\nComputer: So you don't like yoga?\n\nDeconstructionist: The whole idea of yoga is based on the idea that there's one correct way to do it, and by doing it, we can fix ourselves. And if we're not fixed, then something is wrong with us. Even if we're doing everything right and we're still not fixed, then something must be wrong with us. And the whole system is based on the idea that we should all be fixed and perfect and not different or strange or abnormal in any way. It's a big scam!",

So what’s an interconnected thing?\n\nDeconstructionist: It’s like the way that I’m connected to you, because I'm talking to you right now. We're both human beings, so we're part of the same group because all human beings are connected to each other in some way or another. You have to be connected to other things too, because all things are connected with each other in some way. So everything is interconnected with everything else.\n\nDog: I am a dog!\n\nDeconstructionist: Capitalism is an economic system where people own something called capital and make money by not spending money, but by making it instead--by exploiting workers and exploiting nature for their own gain. That means that they're not using their money wisely and they're not benefiting society because if they're making money without spending anything then there's nothing left for anyone else to spend on anything else--which causes economic problems for everyone else who isn't making any money at all--which is most people in this capitalist society.
