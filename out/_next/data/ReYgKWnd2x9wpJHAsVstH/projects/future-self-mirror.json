Graphs and charts don’t convey the full story. So, how might we visualise the available health data in a more motivating way?</p>\n<p>A mirror is the metaphor for self reflection and is an everyday object. We imagined a mirror which gathers data from fitness trackers like fitbits, smartwatches, smartphones, etc and visualises the future health directly on a person’s body while looking at the mirror.</p>\n<p>In a way, it accelerates the time to see your future self staring back at you. Today’s habits shape tomorrow’s image. Daily choices of diet, exercise, stress, smoking, and more have an impact one can see. This mirror augments one’s reflection with visual predictions of future health, made possible by extrapolating the health data from fitness devices and smartphones.\nFor prototyping we used a one way film to make the reflective surface, face recognition and image processing were used to calculate and visualise health. The prototype was exhibited at Trailerpark I/O 2015. The videos for the concept and the documentation of the prototype was exhibited at Ars Electronica 2016.</p>\n<h2>Concept Video</h2>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/140432908?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<h2>Selected Press Coverage</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.psfk.com/2015/10/future-self-mirror-health-tracker-augmented-reality.html\">PSFK</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://prostheticknowledge.tumblr.com/post/130972673286/future-self-mirror-student-speculative-design\">Prosthetic Knowledge</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hypeness.com.br/2015/10/projeto-cria-espelho-que-usa-seus-dados-para-mostrar-como-voce-sera-no-futuro-2/\">Hypeness Brazil</a></p>\n<h2>Exhibitions</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://ciid.dk/trailer-park-festivals-io-exhibition/\">TrailerPark IO 2015</a>, Copenhagen 2015</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ars.electronica.art/center/en/ciid-showcase/\">Ars Electronica</a>, Linz 2016</p>\n","socialImage":"/assets/images/futureself_thumb1.jpg","coverImage":"/assets/images/futureself_thumb1.jpg","details":{"year":"2015","technology":"FaceOSC, Processing","flex":{"label":"In collaboration with","value":"Manu Dixit, Riccardo Cereser & Line Birgitte Borgersen"}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
