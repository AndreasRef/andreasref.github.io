Four chapters are complete and others are in varying stages of progress.</p>\n<p>The book is complemented by a set of 40+ instructional guides maintained by collaborators, along with interactive demos and figures, and video lectures.</p>\n<p>My role in this project has been to help out Gene Kogan with material to support his project. I have contributed with code, guides and tutorials for applications in openFrameworks and ml5js. Additionally, I have taught nine workshops with Gene Kogan since 2017 across three continents with the material from ml4a.</p>\n<p>Besides contributing to ml4a I did a <a href=\"https://medium.com/processing-foundation/from-simple-to-advanced-ml5-js-70d6730b360b\">fellowship for ml5js</a> about demostrating the power of machine learning in the browser to designers and artists.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/221993355\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n","socialImage":"/assets/images/ml4a_thumb1.jpg","coverImage":"/assets/images/ml4a_thumb1.jpg","details":{"year":"2021","technology":"openFrameWorks, ml5.js","flex":{"label":"In collaboration with","value":"Gene Kogan"}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
