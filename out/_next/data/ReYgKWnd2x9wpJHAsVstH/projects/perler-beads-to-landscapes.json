The idea came after having tried NVIDIA GauGAN, named after post-Impressionist painter Paul Gauguin, which creates photorealistic images from segmentation maps. A crowd-trained replica of GauGAN called SPADE Landscapes was ported to RunwayML by Gene Kogan allowing someone like me to interface it .</p>\n<p>I used Processing to have a webcam focus on physical perler beads and did a bit of hacky programming to have the colors match the colors from the segmentation map. See the video above for a walkthrough.</p>\n<p>The interaction opens up a lot of playful opportunities and is something I hope to explore more in the future. </p>\n","socialImage":"assets/images/perler_thumb.jpg","coverImage":"assets/images/perler_thumb.jpg","details":{"year":"2019","technology":"SPADE Landscapes, RunwayML, Processing"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
