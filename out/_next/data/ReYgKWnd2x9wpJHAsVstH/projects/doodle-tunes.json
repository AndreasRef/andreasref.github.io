A camera looks at your drawing, detects instruments that you have drawn, and begins playing electronic music with those instruments.","coverVideo":"https://vimeo.com/197026662","content":"<p>Doodle Tunes is a software application, built with openFrameworks, that uses computer vision (OpenCV) and convolutional neural networks (ofxCcv) to analyze a picture of a piece of paper where instruments have been hand drawn, including bass guitars, saxophones, keyboards, and drums.</p>\n<p>The classifications are made using a convolutional neural network trained on ImageNet, and sends OSC messages to Ableton Live, launching various clips playing the music for each instrument.</p>\n<p>A simplified version of the software is available at <a href=\"https://ml4a.github.io/guides/DoodleClassifier/\">https://ml4a.github.io/guides/DoodleClassifier/</a> </p>\n<p>Made at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0RCcuZpmxg&#x26;ab_channel=artcenternabi\">Nabi AI Hackathon</a> 2016 in Seoul in collaboration with <a href=\"https://genekogan.com/\">Gene Kogan</a>.</p>\n<h2>Selected press:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hackster.io/news/turn-doodles-of-instruments-into-actual-music-d476a093e1a\">Hackster</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://prostheticknowledge.tumblr.com/post/155082719121/doodle-tunes-project-by-andreas-refsgaard-and\">Prosthetic Knowledge</a> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://issuu.com/digicultlibrary/docs/digimag76/74\">Digimag 76</a></p>\n<h2>Exhibitions:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hnf.de/en/permanent-exhibition/exhibition-areas/computers-for-everyone-1980-to-2000/computers-and-creativity-images-and-sounds-made-of-bits-and-bytes.html\">Heinz Nixdorf Museumsforum</a>, Paderborn, Permanent Installation\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BXeaNp3lrSf/?taken-by=qutartmuseum\">QUT Art Museum</a>, Brisbane, 2017 </p>\n","socialImage":"/assets/images/doodle_tunes_thumb.jpg","coverImage":"/assets/images/doodle_tunes_thumb.jpg","details":{"year":"2016","technology":"openFrameworks, Ableton","flex":{"label":"In collaboration with","value":"Gene Kogan"}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
