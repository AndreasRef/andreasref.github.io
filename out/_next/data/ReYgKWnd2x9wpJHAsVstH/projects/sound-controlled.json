If you need to jump over a green slimy alien you say “Ohhh” and to duck you simply clap your hands.\nUsing machine learning we have taught the game to understand and differentiate the sounds. For the game to be able to recognise and distinguish the sounds, we trained it by recording a lot of diverse “ohhh”s and claps which made it robust and easy for anyone to play.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/teddy.gif\" alt=\"Screen recording\" title=\"Screen recording\"></p>\n<p>Wanna try the game yourself?
