You can teach a machine to using your camera, live in the browser – no coding required.\nTry it out for yourself at <a href=\"https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/v1\">https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/v1</a> </p>\n<p>The image recognition is powered by a neural network. It uses the open-source library <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/js\">tensorflow.js</a>, which allows web developers to run machine learning models locally in the browser. The experiment is open-sourced on Github.</p>\n<p>I helped prototype and build Teachable Machine along with Lasse Korsgaard in our former company Støj in 2017. We made this experiment together with Use All Five, Google PAIR and Google Creative Lab.</p>\n<h2>Selected Press Coverage</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.prosa.dk/artikel/ai-og-machine-learning-det-er-sjovt/\">Prosa</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bureaubiz.dk/to-kreative-kodere-laver-loesning-google/\">BureauBiz</a></p>\n<h2>Awards:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://thefwa.com/cases/teachable-machine\">FWA OF THE DAY</a>, November 1st 2017</p>\n","socialImage":"/assets/images/teachable-thumb.jpg","coverImage":"/assets/images/teachable-thumb.jpg","details":{"year":"2017","technology":"tensorflow.js","flex":{"label":"In collaboration with","value":"Lasse Korsgaard, Use All Five & Google Creative Lab + PAIR"}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
